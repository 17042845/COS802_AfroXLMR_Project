# COS802_AfroXLMR_Project
Explores Afro-XLMR for sentiment analysis in low-resource African languages. Fine-tuned on AfriSenti (F1=0.88), but limited zero-shot transfer to isiXhosa (F1=0.48). Few-shot adaptation (500 samples) improved results (F1=0.53). Highlights need for balanced, culturally grounded data.
